# Kickstarter - Excel

## Overview of Project
Our client wants to potentially use a Kickstarter to fund a theatrical play. Using the data provided by the Kickstarter we can determine the projectsâ€™ best chance at success.
  
## Purpose
The purpose of  this project is to provide data analysis on the Kickstarter. Through our assessment we can determine the best possible start date and appropriate funding for a successful project.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered 
* In order to effectivly analyze the data, sorting, organization, and calcualtions were required to identify the overall trends of Kickstarters form 2009 to 2017.
* 
## Results
* Based upon the Launch date 
* From the outcomes based on goals we can conclude that a targeted funding less than $5,000 is mostlikely to be sucessful.
* Some limitations of this data set include the small sample size for monetary goals between $30,000 to $50,000. This can skew the visual representation of the data in "Outcomes Based on Goals" graph.
* An alternative table and/or graph that can be created is a table that compares the different Kickstart categories and the overall sucess in order to determine which category is the mostlikey to suceed. Another graph
